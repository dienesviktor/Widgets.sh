# Widgets.sh

## Story

My friend saw a Windows administrator using widgets like [this](https://win10widgets.com/images/screenshot.png), but he uses Linux and asked you to help me out by writing something similar for his terminal.

## What did I learn?

- Practice writing shell scripts
- Use environment variables in practice
- Use basic control structures
- Learn which files in Linux hide information about the system
